# Lab07
In this lab you will get practice using C pointers. Specifically, you will write a program that implements a 1-D, 122-generation cellular automata (CA) simulation, sending each generation out the USART to be displayed on a PC-based communications terminal. To perform the USART communication, youâ€™ll use subroutines from a UART library provided by your instructor, and you will make use of C pointers to read and write elements in the CA data array. 

Have fun!
